## Animation Progress and requestAnimationFrame

The Web Animation API doesn't allow for keeping track of the progress in a clean way, so, we are forced to use `requestAnimationFrame` to check the current progress of an animation, however, doing, so, can actually decrease framerates, so, I built a system to call `requestAnimationFrame` less often.

`@okikio/animate` stores running `Animate` instances in a Set stored in the `Animate` class's static [RUNNING property](/docs/api/classes/_okikio_animate.Animate.md#running). The RUNNING property only stores `Animate` instances that have registered "update" event listeners.

When an Animate instance is played, it gets added to the `RUNNING` Set, `Animate.requestFrame()` is then called and a single `requestAnimationFrame` runs for all Animate instances in the `RUNNING` set. If after a couple frames a Animate instance doesn't have an attached "update" event listener it is automatically removed from the `RUNNING` Set.

> _**Note**: Animate instances that are finished are also auto-removed, and if there are no Animate instances in the `RUNNING` Set the requestAnimationFrame is stopped._

For you to better understand, check this out (this is meant for visiualization, avoid directly interacting with these API's),

```ts
import { Animate } from "@okikio/"
Animate.RUNNING = new Set();

let instance = new Animate({ /* .... */ });
instance.on("update", () => console.log("It works"));

// If there are "update" event listener
if (instance.emitter.getEvent("update").length > 0) {
    Animate.RUNNING.add(instance);
    if (Animate.animationFrame == null) Animate.requestFrame();
} 
```

If you add an "update" event listener to an Animate instance, the Animate instance is added to the RUNNING Set, and if a `requestAnimationFrame` isn't already running it will request a new one.

By default `requestAnimationFrame` is now throttled to match a maximum frame rate of 60 fps (frames per second). You can change the frame rate by setting `Animate.FRAME_RATE` to your preferred frame rate.

_**Note**: the frame rate affects `tweenAttr`, as it uses the "update" event to animation attributes._

```ts
Animate.FRAME_RATE = 30; // 30 fps
```
