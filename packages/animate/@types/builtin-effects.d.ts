 * I don't really want to put in the effort to create a complete list, so instead just look through the `animate.css` github and copy and paste the effects you need, into using a CSS Keyframe style JSON object, make sure to read the documentation for {@link KeyframeParse}

 * I suggest [@shoelace-style/animations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shoelace-style/animations) for all your animate.css needs.
 *

 *
 * if you just need some quick effects go to [github.com/wellyshen/use-web-animations/](https://github.com/wellyshen/use-web-animations/tree/master/src/animations) and copy the `keyframes` array for the effect you want, remember to say thank you to @wellyshen for all his hardwork, ðŸ˜‚.
