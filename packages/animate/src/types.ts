   * Morphing SVG paths via the `d` property isn't well supported yet, as Gecko (Firefox) & Webkit (Safari) based browsers don't support it yet, and there are other limitations to what the Web Animation API will allow ðŸ˜­, these limitation are covered in detail by an article published by Adobe about [the current state of SVG animation on the web](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/06/05/the-state-of-svg-animation.html#gs.pihpjw). However, animation using paths is now viable through [Motion Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Motion_Path).
   * 
   * You use it like this:
   * ```ts
   * // ...
   * animate({

   *      // The paths have to have the same number of points, that is why the 2 paths below seem similar

   *      ]
   * })

   * 
   * // This is an svg path interpolate function
   * // If used in tandem with `AnimateAttributes`, you can create morphing animations

   *      addPoints: 0,
   *      origin: { x: 0, y: 0 },
   *      optimize: "fill",
   *      precision: 3
   * });
   * 
   * // `tweenAttr` supports all Animation Options with some restrictions and things to note.
   * // 1. Callbacks - the first argument in Animation Options callbacks are set to the progress of the animation beteen 0 and 1, while the other arguments are moved 1 right
   *
   * // So, animation options look like this 
   * // `(progress: number, i: number, len: number, el: HTMLElement) => {

   * ```
   *
   * Using this format, the number of elements in each array does not need to be equal. The provided values will be spaced out independently.

   * The special keys `offset`, `easing`, and `composite` (described below) may be specified alongside the property values.

   * ```ts
   * element.animate({

   *   easing: [ 'ease-in', 'ease-out' ],

   * ```
   *
   * After generating a suitable set of keyframes from the property value lists, each supplied offset is applied to the corresponding keyframe. If there are insufficient values, or if the list contains `null` values, the keyframes without specified offsets will be evenly spaced as with the array format described above.
   *
   * If there are too few `easing` or `composite` values, the corresponding list will be repeated as needed.
   *
   * _**Note**: to use `composite` you will need to add it to the {@link AnimationOptions.extend | extend} object as an option_

   * An `array` of objects (keyframes) consisting of properties and values to iterate over. This is the canonical format returned by the [getKeyframes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyframeEffect/getKeyframes) method.

   *
   * _**Note**: `offset` values, if provided, must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) and arranged in ascending order._
   *
   * It is not necessary to specify an offset for every keyframe. Keyframes without a specified offset will be evenly spaced between adjacent keyframes.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * The easing to apply between keyframes can be specified by providing an easing `value` as illustrated below.
   *
   * _**Note**: the values for easing in keyframes are limited to "ease", "ease-in", "ease-out", "ease-in-out", "linear", "steps(...)", and "cubic-bezier(...)", to get access to the predefined {@link EASINGS | easings}, you will need to use the function {@link GetEase}._

   * @example
   * ```ts
   * element.animate([ { opacity: 1, easing: 'ease-out' },
   *                   { opacity: 0.1, easing: 'ease-in' },

   *                 2000);
   * ```
   *
   * In this example, the specified easing only applies from the keyframe where it is specified until the next keyframe. Any easing value specified on the options argument, however, applies across a single iteration of the animation â€” for the entire duration.
